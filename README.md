Discussing exercises and creating alternative ones

This repo is sort by weeks, in each one we need to clarified the lecture we are talking about. Then add a sufix with the name: L3 Problem 11_m (L3 P11_m) or L4 PSet 2c_m (PS 2c_m).
For alternative exercises versions we can called then as it folows, L4 P11 Quixote_a.
